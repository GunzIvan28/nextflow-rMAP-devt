--
nextflow-rMAP is a Nextflow bioinformatics pipeline that takes its predecessor rMAP through a series of reproducible steps through a 
high level workflow engine. All the steps performed in the rMAP pipeline including: sequence quality control, trimming, De novo assembly, 
genome annotation, SNP variant calling, phylogenetic inference using maximum likelihood methods, resistome profiling, pangenome analysis, 
insertion sequence determination and html report visualization are automated in this pipeline built especially for HPC and cloud compute 
clusters. Please reference the authors of rMAP if using this pipeline.
