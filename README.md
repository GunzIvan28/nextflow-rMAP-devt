# Nextflow Rapid Microbial Analysis Pipeline (nextflow-rMAP)

An rMAP resistome-profiling pipeline implemented in the modern DevOps nextflow engine.
## üé¨ Synopsis
The philosophy on which rMAP was built revolved around the notion of implementing an-easy-to-use optimized one-stop-shop Bioinformatics pipeline relevant for public health surveillance of antimicrobial reistance trends targeting WHO's high priority **ESKAPE** (_Enterococcus faecium_, _Staphylococcus aureus,_ _Klebsiella pneumoniae_, _Acinetobacter baumannii_, _Pseudomonas aeruginosa_, and _Enterobacter_ species) pathogens group using Illumina Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) paired-end reads on a decent PC.

The implementation of rMAP into the modern nextflow engine opens up the vast possibilities of scalability, and reproducibility of this pipeline to overcome the shortcomings of its predecessor. **nextflow-rMAP** is designed for more experienced Bioinformatics users who continuously interract with High Performance Compute (HPC) stations, Cloud and Cluster nodes; providing replicatable, high level intergration with Docker, Conda and Singularity containers whilst eliminating the need to restart long-running pipelines from scratch.
